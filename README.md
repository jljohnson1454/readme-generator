# README Generator

  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen)

  ## Description
  This is a project in which a user can generate a markdown file for project READMEs. Using node.js and the inquirer package, the user will enter information through the command line and upon completion, a README file will generate with the proper format. I've also included license badges and links for the licenses.

  ## Installation
  Please make sure to install Node.js and follow the instructions on their website(https://nodejs.org/en/) before starting the project. Next, please install Inquirer(https://npmjs.com/package/inquirer) in the root directory of the project. Once complete, you can now run the generator by simply typing 'node index' in your command console or terminal.
